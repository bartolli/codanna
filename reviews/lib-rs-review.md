# Code Review: src/lib.rs

## Summary

The `src/lib.rs` file demonstrates excellent adherence to the project's coding principles in error handling and modular organization. The file correctly uses `thiserror` for structured errors and follows proper module organization patterns. However, there are a few minor improvements that could enhance type safety and API design.

## Issues Found

### Issue: Consider More Selective Re-exports

**Severity**: Low  
**Location**: `/Users/bartolli/Projects/codebase-intelligence/src/lib.rs:12-19`  
**Problem**: The wildcard re-export on line 12 (`pub use types::*;`) could lead to namespace pollution and make it harder to track what's actually exported.

Current code:
```rust
pub use types::*;
pub use symbol::{Symbol, CompactSymbol, StringTable, Visibility};
```

Suggested improvement:
```rust
// Be explicit about what's exported from types
pub use types::{SymbolId, FileId, Range, SymbolKind, IndexingResult};
pub use symbol::{Symbol, CompactSymbol, StringTable, Visibility};
```

**Benefit**: Explicit exports improve API clarity and prevent unintended exposures when new types are added to the types module.

### Issue: Missing Must-Use Annotations

**Severity**: Medium  
**Location**: `/Users/bartolli/Projects/codebase-intelligence/src/lib.rs:19`  
**Problem**: Result type aliases should have `#[must_use]` to prevent accidentally ignoring errors.

Current code:
```rust
pub use error::{IndexError, ParseError, StorageError, McpError, IndexResult, ParseResult, StorageResult, McpResult};
```

While these are re-exports, the original type aliases in `error.rs` should be annotated:

```rust
/// Result type alias for index operations
#[must_use = "Index operations may fail and errors should be handled"]
pub type IndexResult<T> = Result<T, IndexError>;
```

**Benefit**: Compiler warnings when results are accidentally ignored, improving error handling discipline.

## Positive Observations

1. **Excellent Error Design**: The error module follows best practices perfectly:
   - Uses `thiserror` for structured errors (compliant with **MUST** requirement)
   - Provides actionable recovery suggestions via `recovery_suggestions()` method
   - Includes context in error messages (file paths, operation details)
   - Follows the library/application split pattern correctly

2. **Type-Driven Design**: The types module demonstrates excellent newtype usage:
   - `SymbolId(u32)` and `FileId(u32)` instead of raw `u32` (compliant with **MUST** requirement)
   - Proper validation in constructors (rejecting 0 values)
   - All types implement `Debug` as required

3. **API Ergonomics**: 
   - Clean module organization with logical grouping
   - All public types have appropriate trait implementations (`Debug`, `Clone`, `PartialEq`, etc.)
   - Helper methods like `value()` and `to_u32()` provide convenient access

4. **Zero-Cost Abstractions**: 
   - The `compact_string` function correctly returns `Box<str>` for memory efficiency
   - Parsing functions like `extract_imports` correctly take `&str` parameters instead of `String`

## Overall Recommendation

The codebase demonstrates excellent adherence to the project's Rust coding principles. The code is well-structured, type-safe, and follows idiomatic Rust patterns. The minor improvements suggested above would further enhance the already high-quality codebase.

**Next Steps**:
1. Replace the wildcard import with explicit exports
2. Add `#[must_use]` annotations to Result type aliases in error.rs
3. Continue following these excellent patterns in new code

The project is on track to meet its performance targets with clean, maintainable code that leverages Rust's type system effectively.
