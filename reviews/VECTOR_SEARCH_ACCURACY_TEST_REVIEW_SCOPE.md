# Vector Search Accuracy Test - Quality Review Scope

## File to Review
`/Users/bartolli/Projects/codebase-intelligence/tests/vector_search_accuracy_test.rs`

## Review Focus Areas

### 1. Adherence to CLAUDE.md Principles (High Priority)

Review the following sections for compliance:

**Lines 1-50: Type Definitions and Imports**
- Check if SearchTestCase should use `&'static str` or if owned types are justified
- Verify proper use of newtypes (RelevanceScore)
- Check for any primitive obsession

**Lines 51-150: Error Types and SearchMetrics**
- Verify thiserror usage and error context
- Check if errors are actionable with recovery suggestions
- Review SearchMetrics methods for zero-cost abstractions

**Lines 200-300: Core Functions**
- `perform_semantic_search`: Check for unnecessary String allocations
- `is_relevant`: Verify &str usage over String
- `calculate_metrics`: Check for iterator usage over collections

**Lines 400-600: Test Implementation**
- Check for hardcoded values that should be constants
- Verify proper error propagation
- Look for opportunities to use Cow<str>

### 2. Specific Code Quality Checks

**Mock Implementation Concerns (Lines 250-350)**
- The test uses mock semantic search instead of real vectors
- Check if this mock is adequate for integration testing
- Suggest improvements for better realism

**Test Data Management (Lines 100-200)**
- Review how test cases are structured
- Check if test data could be externalized
- Verify no hardcoded paths

**Metrics Calculation (Lines 150-250)**
- Verify precision/recall calculations are correct
- Check for potential division by zero
- Review floating point comparisons

### 3. Integration Patterns

**VectorSearchEngine Usage**
- Check if the integration with VectorSearchEngine is proper
- Look for any workarounds that indicate API issues
- Verify proper resource cleanup

### 4. Testing Best Practices

- Check if tests are isolated and repeatable
- Verify meaningful test names
- Look for proper use of assertions
- Check test output verbosity

## Expected Deliverables

Create a markdown report (`VECTOR_SEARCH_ACCURACY_TEST_REVIEW.md`) with:

1. **High Priority Issues** - Must fix before proceeding
   - CLAUDE.md violations
   - Memory/performance concerns
   - Incorrect implementations

2. **Medium Priority Issues** - Should fix for maintainability
   - Code organization improvements
   - Better error messages
   - API design suggestions

3. **Low Priority Issues** - Nice to have
   - Style improvements
   - Additional test cases
   - Documentation suggestions

Format each issue as:
```markdown
### Issue: [Title]
**Priority**: High/Medium/Low
**Location**: Lines X-Y, function_name
**Problem**: Description of the issue
**Suggestion**: How to fix it
**Example**: Code snippet if helpful
```

## Review Constraints

- Focus only on the vector_search_accuracy_test.rs file
- Prioritize CLAUDE.md compliance over other concerns
- Be specific with line numbers and function names
- Provide actionable suggestions, not just criticisms
