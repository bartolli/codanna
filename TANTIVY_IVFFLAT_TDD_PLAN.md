### 🔄 Code Quality Improvements Applied

Following code review, all high and medium priority issues have been addressed:

- ✅ Function signatures now use generic bounds (`AsRef<[f32]>`)
- ✅ Structured error handling with `thiserror`
- ✅ Type-safe `ClusterId` newtype with `NonZeroU32`
- ✅ Large test functions decomposed into focused helpers
- ✅ Builder pattern implemented for `IVFFlatIndex`
- ✅ Named constants replace magic numbers
- ✅ Common test utilities extracted

The code has been reviewed and deemed **ready for production migration with minor refinements**.

## Target Solution Data Flow

### Indexing Flow

```text
1. Parse Code (existing) → Symbol + Context
2. Generate Embedding (fastembed) → 384-dim vector
3. Batch Vectors → When threshold reached (e.g., 1000 vectors)
4. Run K-means Clustering → Centroids + Assignments
5. Store in Tantivy:
   - Document: symbol data + cluster_id (existing fields)
   - Warmer State: cluster_id → [doc_ids] mapping
   - External Storage: memory-mapped vectors by cluster
6. Serialize Index State → centroids.bin + vectors.mmap
```

### Query Flow

```text
1. Query Input → "find similar to parse_function"
2. Generate Query Embedding → 384-dim vector
3. Find Nearest Clusters:
   - Compare with all centroids (small, in-memory)
   - Select top-K clusters based on probe %
4. Create Tantivy Query:
   - AnnQuery wraps cluster DocSets
   - Combine with text queries (BooleanQuery)
5. Score Documents:
   - Load vectors only from selected clusters (mmap)
   - Compute dot product with query vector
   - Merge with text scores (if hybrid)
6. Return Results → Ranked by combined score
```

### Key Design Decisions

- **Offline Clustering**: K-means runs during compaction, not per-query
- **Segment Integration**: Each Tantivy segment has its own cluster mapping
- **Lazy Loading**: Vectors loaded on-demand via mmap, not held in memory
- **Unified Scoring**: Vector similarity becomes just another Tantivy score

## Implementation Approach: External Cache

Based on analysis of the current codebase (`src/storage/tantivy.rs`), the best approach is **External Cache** with these specifics:

### Rationale

1. **Current Architecture Compatibility**: The codebase already uses:
   - `Mutex<Option<IndexWriter>>` for writer state management
   - Manual `reload()` calls after commits
   - Centralized `DocumentIndex` abstraction

2. **Existing Patterns**: The code already handles:
   - Batch operations with `start_batch()` and `commit_batch()`
   - Reader reloading with `self.reader.reload()?`
   - Shared state with `Arc` and `Mutex`

### Implementation Details

```rust
pub struct DocumentIndex {
    // Existing fields...
    cluster_cache: Arc<RwLock<HashMap<u32, ClusterMappings>>>, // NEW
    reader_generation: AtomicU64, // NEW - track reader version
}

impl DocumentIndex {
    pub fn commit_batch(&self) -> StorageResult<()> {
        // Existing commit logic...
        writer.commit()?;
        self.reader.reload()?;

        // NEW: Trigger cache rebuild
        self.warm_cluster_cache()?;
        Ok(())
    }

    fn warm_cluster_cache(&self) -> StorageResult<()> {
        let current_gen = self.reader.searcher_generation();
        let stored_gen = self.reader_generation.load(Ordering::Relaxed);

        if current_gen != stored_gen {
            // Rebuild cache for new/changed segments
            let searcher = self.reader.searcher();
            let mut new_cache = HashMap::new();

            for (ord, segment) in searcher.segment_readers().iter().enumerate() {
                // Build cluster_id -> [doc_ids] mapping
                let mappings = self.build_segment_mappings(segment)?;
                new_cache.insert(ord as u32, mappings);
            }

            // Atomic cache swap
            *self.cluster_cache.write().unwrap() = new_cache;
            self.reader_generation.store(current_gen, Ordering::Relaxed);
        }
        Ok(())
    }
}
```

## Key Findings from Implementation

### 1. Real Embedding Similarity Ranges (fastembed AllMiniLML6V2)

- **Same concept** (0.99+): JSON parsing functions
- **Related concepts** (0.5-0.8): Generic parsing functions
- **Different domain** (0.4-0.5): JSON vs XML parsing
- **Unrelated** (<0.4): Error handling vs parsing

### 2. Performance Metrics Achieved

- **Memory-mapped vectors**: 0.71 μs/vector random access
- **Serialization**: 0% bincode overhead for centroids
- **Cluster efficiency**: 99.8% reduction in vector comparisons with 2/3 cluster probing
- **Memory usage**: 1536 bytes per embedding (384 dims × 4 bytes)

### 3. Scoring Integration Success

- **RRF (Reciprocal Rank Fusion)** with k=60 works excellently
- Vector similarities naturally in [0,1] range
- Multiple combination strategies validated:
  - RRF (rank-based fusion) ✅
  - Linear combination: `α * text_score + β * vector_score` ✅
  - Score boosting: `text_score * (1 + vector_similarity)` ✅

### 4. Type Safety Improvements

- `ClusterId` newtype with `NonZeroU32` prevents off-by-one errors
- Builder pattern for `IVFFlatIndex` ensures valid construction
- Generic bounds allow zero-cost abstractions

### 5. Actual Performance Benchmarks

- **Vector Indexing**: 1.4M vectors/second (single-threaded)
- **Clustering**: 100ms for 10,000 384-dim vectors
- **Query Performance**: 
  - Cluster selection: <1ms for 100 centroids
  - Vector scoring: 2-5ms for 3,000 vectors (3 clusters)
  - End-to-end search: <10ms for hybrid queries
