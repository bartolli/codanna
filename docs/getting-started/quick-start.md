## Install

```bash
cargo install codanna --all-features
```

## Setup

Initialize Codanna in your project:

```bash
codanna init
```

This creates `.codanna/settings.toml` with default configuration.

## Index Your Code

Build a searchable index from your codebase:

```bash
# See what would be indexed (dry run, optional)
codanna index src --dry-run

# Index your code
codanna index src --progress
```

## Ask Real Questions

```bash
# Semantic search - finds functions with auth-related doc comments
codanna mcp semantic_search_docs query:"where do we resolve symbol references" limit:3
```

## How Accurate and Fast is Codanna?

Try it yourself:

```bash
# Run with `time` like this
time codanna mcp semantic_search_docs query:"where do we resolve symbol references" limit:3
```
