# Architecture

High-performance code intelligence system in Rust. Indexes code, tracks relationships, serves via MCP.

## How It Works

1. **Parse fast** - Tree-sitter AST parsing (same as GitHub code navigator) for Rust, Python, TypeScript, Go and PHP (more on deck)
2. **Extract real stuff** - functions, traits, type relationships, call graphs
3. **Embed** - semantic vectors built from your doc comments
4. **Index** - Tantivy + memory-mapped symbol cache for <10ms lookups
5. **Serve** - MCP protocol for AI assistants, ~300ms response time (HTTP/HTTPS) and stdio built-in (0.16s)

- **[Memory Mapping](memory-mapping.md)** - Cache and storage design
- **[Embedding Model](embedding-model.md)** - Semantic search implementation
- **[Language Support](language-support.md)** - Parser system and adding languages

## Architecture Highlights

**Memory-mapped storage**: Two caches for different access patterns:
- `symbol_cache.bin` - FNV-1a hashed symbol lookups, <10ms response time
- `segment_0.vec` - 384-dimensional vectors, <1μs access after OS page cache warm-up

**Embedding lifecycle management**: Old embeddings deleted when files are re-indexed to prevent accumulation.

**Lock-free concurrency**: DashMap for concurrent symbol reads, write coordination via single writer lock.

**Single-pass indexing**: Symbols, relationships, and embeddings extracted in one AST traversal.

**Language-aware semantic search**: Embeddings track source language, enabling filtering before similarity computation. No score redistribution - identical docs produce identical scores regardless of filtering.

**Hot reload**: File watcher with 500ms debounce triggers re-indexing of changed files only.

## Performance

Parser benchmarks on a 750-symbol test file:

| Language | Parsing Speed | vs. Target (10k/s) | Status |
|----------|---------------|-------------------|--------|
| **Rust** | 91,318 symbols/sec | 9.1x faster ✓ | Production |
| **Python** | 75,047 symbols/sec | 7.5x faster ✓ | Production |
| **TypeScript** | 82,156 symbols/sec | 8.2x faster ✓ | Production |
| **PHP** | 68,432 symbols/sec | 6.8x faster ✓ | Production |
| **Go** | 74,655 symbols/second | 7.5x faster ✓ | Production |

Run performance benchmarks:
```bash
codanna benchmark all          # Test all parsers
codanna benchmark python       # Test specific language
```
