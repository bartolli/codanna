# TDD Progress: Vector Search Update and Reindexing

## ðŸš¨ PRIORITY: Test 10 Must Be Completed Before Integration Testing

Test 10 is critical for real-world usage as it connects the vector system to the existing indexing pipeline. Without it:
- Can't detect symbol-level changes (whitespace vs signature changes)
- Can't perform incremental updates (<100ms target impossible)
- Integration tests would be incomplete and unrealistic
- Tests 11-12 capabilities can't be properly utilized

## Test 10: File Update with Vector Reindexing - IN PROGRESS

### Design Goals
- [x] Design API for detecting symbol-level changes when files are updated
- [x] Create test scenarios for different update patterns
- [x] Define SymbolChangeDetector trait for comparing old/new symbols
- [x] Extend IndexTransaction to handle vector updates alongside document updates
- [x] Design vector storage update API that maintains consistency with Tantivy segments

### Test Scenarios to Implement
- [x] File with unchanged symbols (hash changed but symbols identical)
- [x] File with modified function signatures (embedding should update)
- [x] File with added/removed functions (vector add/delete)
- [x] File with renamed functions (old vector removed, new added)
- [x] Batch update of multiple files
- [x] Concurrent update handling
- [x] Update rollback on failure

### Integration Points
- [ ] SimpleIndexer in src/indexing/simple.rs handles file updates
- [ ] DocumentIndex in src/storage/tantivy.rs manages document storage
- [ ] IndexTransaction in src/indexing/transaction.rs for atomic updates
- [ ] FileInfo in src/indexing/file_info.rs tracks file hashes

### Performance Targets
- [ ] Incremental update <100ms per file
- [ ] Only regenerate embeddings for changed symbols
- [ ] Maintain <10ms query latency during updates
- [ ] Memory usage proportional to changed symbols only

### Files to Create
- [x] tests/vector_update_test.rs - Main test file for update scenarios
- [ ] Define production API structure in src/vector/update.rs (future)
- [ ] Extend IVFFlatIndex with update capabilities

### Implementation Components Needed

1. **SymbolChangeDetector** (src/vector/change_detector.rs)
   - Compare old vs new symbols by hash
   - Detect signature changes vs whitespace-only changes
   - Return ChangeSet { added, modified, removed }

2. **VectorUpdateCoordinator** (src/vector/update_coordinator.rs)
   - Integrate with SimpleIndexer's update flow
   - Track file â†’ symbol â†’ vector mappings
   - Coordinate with incremental clustering (Test 11)

3. **Extend IndexTransaction** (src/indexing/transaction.rs)
   - Add vector operations alongside document operations
   - Ensure atomicity across both text and vector indices
   - Handle rollback scenarios properly

### Status
- [x] Ready for test creation
- [x] Test design complete
- [x] Tests written (currently #[ignore])
- [ ] **IN PROGRESS: Implement POC components**
- [ ] Remove #[ignore] from tests and verify passing
- [ ] Production implementation started
- [ ] Migration complete

## Test 11: Incremental Clustering Updates âœ… COMPLETE

### Design Goals
- [x] Design API for incremental vector additions without full re-clustering
- [x] Create cluster quality monitoring system
- [x] Implement cluster rebalancing when needed
- [x] Maintain cluster cache consistency during updates

### Test Scenarios Implemented
- [x] Add vectors to existing clusters (9,500 vectors/sec achieved)
- [x] Monitor cluster quality degradation (threshold detection working)
- [x] Rebalance clusters when uneven (<5Î¼s operations)
- [x] Thread-safe cache updates with versioning (~4KB/1000 vectors)

### Status
- [x] Test implementation complete
- [x] Performance targets exceeded
- [x] Code quality review passed (9/10 score)
- [x] Ready for production migration

## Test 12: Vector Storage Segment Management âœ… COMPLETE

### Design Goals
- [x] Design vector storage aligned with Tantivy segments
- [x] Handle segment merging with vector consolidation
- [x] Implement orphaned vector cleanup
- [x] Ensure atomic updates across text and vector indices

### Test Scenarios Implemented
- [x] Vector files alongside Tantivy segments
- [x] Segment merging with vector file consolidation
- [x] Orphaned vector detection and cleanup (<1Î¼s operations)
- [x] Atomic transactions with rollback capability

### Status
- [x] Test implementation complete
- [x] Integration patterns validated
- [x] Code quality review passed (9/10 score)
- [x] Ready for production migration
